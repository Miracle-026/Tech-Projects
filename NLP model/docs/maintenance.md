# Maintenance Guide

This document outlines procedures for maintaining the `nlp-continual-learning` repository, including dependency updates, model retraining, and monitoring.

## 1. Dependency Updates

### Practices
- **Regular Updates**: Check for outdated dependencies monthly to ensure security and compatibility.
- **Test Updates**: Validate updates in a development environment before deploying to production.
- **Pin Versions**: Use specific versions in `requirements.txt` to avoid breaking changes.

### Implementation
Update dependencies using `pip`:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip list --outdated
pip install --upgrade package_name
